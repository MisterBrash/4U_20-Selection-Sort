Another extremely common method which finds the largest item in the array and swaps it with the last item. Once an item has been placed at the end, the length of the search window is decreased by 1 and that item is never moved again. This greatly reduces the number of swaps but still requires many comparisons.

In the "Find the Largest" version, on each pass of the algorithm:
- Find the index of the largest value in the search window
- Swap that item with the item at the end of the search window
- Reduce the search window length by 1
- Repeat

### Alternative Version

Another version will find the _lowest_ item and swap it to the _front_ of the array. Functionally there is no difference. Here is an animation of _that_ version:

## Exercises
1. Code the `selection_sort()` function [described below](#code).
2. (_optional_) Code the extra functions [listed below](#code).
3. Answer the Discussion Questions ([also below](#discussion-questions)) in your [index.html](index.html) file.

### Code:

1. Write the function `selection_sort(unsortedArray, debug = false)` inside [script.js](script.js). This function will sort the contents in a _copy_ of **unsortedArray** using [the description of Selection Sort given above](#33---selection-sort). Move **_large_ items to the _end_ of the list**. It will _return_ the sorted array. The `debug` flag, if `true`, causes the function to print the array to the web page after each _swap_. Feel free to copy and paste useful code from previous projects for this.

2. (optional) Write the function `topX(x, data)` which returns an array of the top (largest) `x` items in the array **`data`**. It will utilize a _partial_ selection sort, **only sorting the top `x` elements** and return that sorted array of size `x`. The returned array should be sorted in _ascending_ order. **Pay close attention to the mention of _partial sort_**.
 
3. (optional) Write the function `bottomX(x, data)`. Similar to `topX`, it will use a _partial_ selection sort and return the bottom (lowest) `x` many values from the array **`data`**. (Also _ascending_ order)
  
4. (optional) Write the function `rank(value, data)` that returns the numeric rank (position) of the first instance of `value` in the _unsorted_ array `data`. Return -1 if the value is not found. **For example:**<br>
    ```JS
    > rank(13, [19,3,0,52,13,4,9,2,0,1])
    8
    
    > rank(4, [19,3,0,52,13,4,9,2,0,1])
    6
    
    > rank(8, [19,3,0,52,13,4,9,2,0,1])
    -1

    > rank(0, [19,3,0,52,13,4,9,2,0,1])
    1
    ```

    **Note** - As with the previous sorting tasks, you are permitted to write your own helper functions, utilize the functions in the [`Library`](library.js), or copy useful code you wrote for previous projects.

### Discussion Questions:

Answer the following discussion questions in the [index.html](index.html) file.

1. What would you have to change in your code of `selection_sort()` to have it sort in _descending_ order? Include the line-number(s) from your `script.js` file when discussing your answer.
2. What would you have to change in your code for `selection_sort()` to have it swap the lowest value to the front of the array instead of the largest to the end? Include the line-number(s) from your `script.js` file in your answer.
3. Is Selection Sort ‚Äústable‚Äù? Explain your reasoning.

Note - [the HTML file](index.html) has not been set up for your answers. You will need to do this.
